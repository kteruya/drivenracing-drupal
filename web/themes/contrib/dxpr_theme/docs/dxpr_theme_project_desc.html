  <h3>Intelligent dropdown menu system</h3>
  <p>DXPR Theme features an intelligent dropdown menu system that automatically adapts based on the menu item's href value. When a menu item with children has a valid URL, it renders as a split button—the link navigates to the URL while a separate caret button toggles the dropdown menu. When a menu item with children uses a placeholder href (such as "#" or &lt;nolink&gt;), the entire item becomes a dropdown toggle with an integrated caret icon. This smart behavior ensures proper accessibility with clear visual indicators while maintaining intuitive navigation patterns. The system supports multi-level nested submenus, automatic multi-column layouts for large menus, and full keyboard navigation for an accessible user experience.</p>
